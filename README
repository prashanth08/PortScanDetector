CS5434 Homework 2: Port scan detector
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> Student name : Prashanth Basappa		
> NetID        : pb476

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. We again need to be sure that you understand the important notice posted on
   page one of the homework. In your own words, please re-summarize it.

> If we run exploits or network reconnaissance on systems that are not meantfor 
> this course, we will be in serious trouble. I will keep all my activities
> on this virtual machine.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. We also need to be sure that you understand and have adhered to the academic
   integrity policies as outlined by the University. Please state here if you
   have read them and you comprehend the consequences of violating these
   policies.

> I will submit all the work achieved by my own individual effort. There will
> no collaboration with any other student. If found guilty of violating these
> rules, there may be serious consequences including expulsion.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Did you do this homework on your own? (General discussion with other
   students is fine; sharing code or copying from the Internet is not
   acceptable.)

> Yes, this homework was done by me.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Briefly explain the importance of network byte ordering in packet headers.

> If the sending and receiving machine don't have the same byte order,then the
> receiver cannot interpret the data sent and will read as garbage. Hence, the 
> Internet specifies a canonical byte order convention known as network byteorder.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. How big is (a) the ethernet header, (b) a typical IP header with no options,
   (c) a typical TCP header with no options and (d) a typical UDP header?
   Answer in bytes.

> Ethernet header            : 14
> IP header with no options  : 20
> TCP header with no options : 20
> UDP header                 : 8

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Is the Sophos port scan detection heuristic foolproof? Briefly explain why.

> No,it is not foolproof.The Sophos detection time range is 300ms and detection 
> score must exceed 21 for a single source IP address. So if our client-side 
> port scanner can scan minimum number of open ports or if it can increase its 
> detection time range, it can bypass the Sophos port scan detection. Also,
> Sophos only detects SYN scans - other scanning methods (FIN, XMAS) aren't 
> being dealt with and an attacker that uses these could get away undetected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. One way to implement the port scan detector is to buffer all packets within
   the last 300ms and then inspect them every 1ms to search for port scans. Why
   is this a bad idea? How did/would you implement the inspection algorithm
   so that it does not depend on packet buffering?

> Buffering all packets within the last 300ms is a bad idea. It 
> increases the probability of buffer overflow and causes latency delay
> in processing packets. The detector should parse multiple buffers for 
> 300 overlapping windows - making the solution trivial. Also,
> a packet's lifetime might have run out.
> I would implement the inspection algorithm by keeping a 
> run time window buffer that keeps track of packet timestamps 
> and only counts those that have been received in the last 300ms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Before submission, did you make sure that your .zip file contains only 
   detector.c, detector.h and this README file?

> Yes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. (this question is not graded and is optional). Did you enjoy this homework?
   Was it very educational? What suggestions do you have to improve future
   iterations of this assignment? Also feel free to add any other comments
   here.

> Yes, it was educational. I was exposed to libpcap and network byte addressing.
> The tutorial class meant for this HW was very useful.
> Also, I would like to see more TA hours every week, so that it doesn't 
> become hectic towards the end.

Part I
>When nmap was used to determine the open ports in the virtual machine, only
>PORT 631 was open. It's protocol is TCP and its service IPP(Internet Printing 
>Protocol). It is not critical to the functioning of the OS, unless the OS needs 
>to print something.
